# Description

Game Reviews is a MERN Stack Video Game Review Application. It is a web-based platform that allows users to review and rate their favorite video games. The application is built using MongoDB for storing data, Express.js for server-side routing, React.js for client-side rendering, and Node.js for server-side scripting. Users can write and submit their reviews of video games, edit their existing reviews, and delete their reviews if they no longer want them on the platform. This application provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for video game enthusiasts to share their opinions and engage with others in the gaming community.

# Strech Goals

-Cleanup code

-Fix image carousel for home page

-Get video games to display average rating

-On the review page, only display the reviews and no ability to click on them. Give the ability to the user to delete and update their review on that page rather than a seperate page.
